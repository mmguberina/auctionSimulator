4. runs with different demand and/or supply curves --- maybe
5. write literature review
6. compare up and vcg in report


not priority
------------
1. save only iterations which happened in epoch
2. clean up code even more
3. convert everything you can to numpy

can't but wish i could
-----------------------
1. new optimizations algorithms
2. strategy space is a neural net trained with rl
