TODO:
- fill stuff in code files
- make the code save stuff in text files in the log directory
- make it better
- repeat previous point until satisfaction or deadline is reached


-	Negative random movement in PSO -- Samuel
-	Removing appends -- Nima
    - Because otherwise it will converge to the center
-	Logging the results
  -	 Triangle plot
    -	Labeling the corners
    -	Arrows
  -	SW at each epoch -- Nima
  -	logging the resutls in Pandas --Nima
  -	3D plot including the triangle and then at z the epoch payoff
-	VCG has to be checked (why not truthful convergence) -- Nima
-	Speeding up the code -- Marko
-	Another bidding strategy --Nima and Samuel
    - parameter per bid GA -- Marko	
-	Re-run the total epoch and then plot -- Nima
-	Termination criteria -- Samuel
-	Another strategy update method
